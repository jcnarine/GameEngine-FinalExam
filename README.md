### Game Description


The game that we have created is called **Galaga.** In this game, you play as a spaceship flying through space as you attempt to survive by shooting your way through wave after waves of enemy spacecraft and asteroids. Each wave lasts around 10 seconds and the amount of enemies and asteroids vary each wave. Your goal is to survive until the final wave is complete.
